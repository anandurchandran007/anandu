The first method for creating text files uses the “cat” command. Type the following command at the prompt and press Enter. Replace “sample.txt” with the name you want to use for your file.

    cat > sample.txt

After pressing Enter, you are not returned to the prompt. Instead, the cursor is placed on the next line, allowing you to enter text into your file. Type your lines of text, pressing Enter after each one. When you are done, press Ctrl + D to exit the file and return to the prompt.
